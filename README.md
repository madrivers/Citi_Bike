# Citi_Bike Challenge

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is focused on usage and the downstream impacts of usage for bicycles in a specific city.  The usage is broken up by Gender, Age, Customer Type among others. This type of data allows to quickly categorize summary level information such as starting locations for rides

or the which bike IDs may need more maintenace than others based on usage.

## Results

Check Out times for Users outlines that time a bike is checked out for is primarily for shorter trips  and has a steep decline rate after 15 to 20 minutes

The data can be further refined by gender, indicating that usage by Males is higher than non males by quite a bit.

Heatmap visuals provide a quick option for visually undersatnding "hot spots" (pun intended) or high usage areas where users can focus their attention or efforts for more detail.  The heatmap by Hour indicates early morning and late afternoon or peak work commute times during the week drive usage.  In the weekends however, usage is more evenly distributed throughout the day

Continuing with heat maps we can see the time of day distribution holds for both Female and Male users, but usage overall is higher by males.  The data for customers that did not provide that information is not useful.

Finally we are able to see that those customers that are subscribers use the serivces more heavily and are again dominated by Male users during the typical Monday through Friday work week.

## Summary
These visualizations have the potential to provide excellent insights into the trends of a business that would be critical for exansion discussions within the same city or expansion into other cities.  In order for the data to be applicable for new cities, a tableau analysis on the demographics of the cities and how they compare to the baseline would be very helpful.  From a business standpoint in order to attract additional investors, visualizations that depict revenue, cost and profit by a variety of demographics would be very useful.
